# General LSTM and RNN notes

> _*"based on Brownian Motion, the future variations of stock price are independent of the past"*_ [src](https://towardsdatascience.com/lstm-for-google-stock-price-prediction-e35f5cc84165)

- meaning predicting exact price is somewhat impossible, but capturing the trend can be done.

- Long short term memory networks are a type of RNN capable of learning order dependence in sequence predictions.

> "RNNs can only connect recent previous information and cannot connect information as the time gap grows. This is where LSTMs come into play; LSTMs are a type of RNN that remember information over long periods of time, making them better suited for predicting stock prices.

## `Final solution`

- Due to the lack of data for Borouge's stock price history I will train a LSTM model on ADNOC's price history and use a transfer learning approach. From what I've seen and tested this should work; however, time series data is very uncertain...
- The 'baseline' dataset (aka. _source domain_) would be ADNOCs price history. I would then be transferring the learned weights to serve as an initialization for the model to be trained on Borouge's data (the _target domain_).
