# LSTM based recurrent neural network for share price prediction

- This repository contains the data used to train, test, and validate the aforementioned LSTM (long short-term memory) model. It also contains a python notebook which holds the neural network itself along with other notes I gathered under the [notes](./notes/) directory.
- This is still a work in progress, I would not be confident in saying that the results are reliable :laughing:; for several reasons, among those my presupposition regarding the lack of data.
